# Ray-Tracer
This project is for CS410 Computer Graphics. It builds a rendering system for generating an image by tracing the path of light as pixels in an image plane and simulating the effects of its encounters with virtual objects.
## Input
* scene model (objects, surfaces & materials)
* lighting models
* camera models
## Output
* an image showing what the camera would see
## Details
* capable of producing illumination effects including ambient, diffuse and specular lighting, refraction and reflection
* applied anti-aliased to generate a smoother image
